# ncurses 6 includes the tmux terminfo, but many servers are running on
# stable or ass-backwards OS's, hence using a tmux* term would break
# things. The only effective difference between tmux* and screen* are
# the added escape codes for italics, so it's safe to signal screen for
# ssh sessions.
#
# Changelog:
#   2017-03-13  Synchronize some files to remote on `ssh $remote`
#   2016-09-11  Add term overwrite for termite
